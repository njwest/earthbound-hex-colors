# Earthbound Hex Colors

This is a simple set of Earthbound (SNES) colors set to sass variables.
Many of these colors were sampled from the different Earthbound UI "themes,"
e.g.: banana, peanut butter, etc, and their related dialog box borders/backgrounds. 

Other colors were sampled from different characters/objects/scenery within the game,
e.g. Frank, cactus, hotel floor tiles, etc.
